#hypothesis testing
'''
    Price Difference between Categories:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in prices between different categories.
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in prices between different categories.
        Test: One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or t-tests for comparing means.

    Effect of Commodity Type on Price:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): The type of commodity does not significantly affect the price.
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The type of commodity has a significant effect on the price.
        Test: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) or t-tests for comparing means.

    Geographical Variation in Prices:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no spatial variation in prices (no correlation between prices and geographical location).
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a spatial variation in prices.
        Test: Spatial autocorrelation analysis or correlation tests.

    Temporal Trends in Prices:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant temporal trend in prices over time.
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant temporal trend in prices.
        Test: Time series analysis or regression analysis.

    Price Difference by Price Type:
        Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in prices between different price types.
        Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in prices between different price types.
        Test: t-tests or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
